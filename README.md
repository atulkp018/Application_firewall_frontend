## Project Overview 🚀

Guardian Shield is a context-aware application firewall developed for the Smart India Hackathon 2024, where our team was among the top 48 finalists selected from over 1000+ teams. The project was showcased at the Grand Finale in Ahmedabad, hosted by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation).

The frontend interface provides a robust, user-friendly dashboard for monitoring and controlling network traffic, managing endpoints, and implementing security policies in real-time.

## Key Features ✨

- **Real-time Network Monitoring**: Interactive graphs and visualizations for network traffic analysis
- **Endpoint Management**: Comprehensive interface for managing and monitoring multiple endpoints
- **Policy Configuration**: Intuitive policy creation and deployment system
- **Alert Dashboard**: Real-time alert monitoring with detailed insights
- **Activity Monitoring**: Visual representation of normal vs. abnormal activities
- **DPI (Deep Packet Inspection)**: Advanced packet analysis and visualization

## Technical Architecture 🏗️

The project follows a distributed architecture with three main components:

1. **Frontend (This Repository)**: React-based web console for monitoring and control
2. **Backend**: FastAPI-powered REST service for data processing and policy management
3. **Agent**: Distributed monitoring system using Scapy and TensorFlow for network analysis

## Tech Stack 💻

### Frontend Technologies
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- React.js for dynamic UI components
- Chart.js for real-time data visualization

### Backend Integration
- FastAPI for high-performance REST APIs
- MongoDB Atlas for scalable data storage
- AI/ML integration with TensorFlow
